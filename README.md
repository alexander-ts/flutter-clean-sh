# flutter-clean-sh
Small shell script that cleans all Flutter projects in a directory.

## Overview

I work with many Flutter projects. As the number of projects grew, the build directories also got bigger. I usually forget to clean the old projects, so I wrote this script to clean them all at once.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-cleaner.git
   cd flutter-cleaner
    ```
2. **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x flutter-clean.sh
    ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./flutter-clean.sh /your/flutter/projects/directory
   ```
